##### How MongoDB works in code ?

    1. Schema - Define the structure
        Model - using schema we create model
        Using Model - we do CRUD operations

    1. It is a function that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle.
    2. It runs everytime b/w request-response cycle.
